# Phase 3: Cold Call Playbook + CRM Pipeline — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add a dedicated Call Prep page with GPT-generated cold call playbooks (5 sections), call notes, and a CRM pipeline (NEW → CLOSED WON/LOST) with auto-status transitions, status badges, and filtering.

**Architecture:** New `scriptgen.py` module generates playbooks via GPT-4o-mini with mock fallback. New PATCH endpoint updates status/notes. New Next.js route `/practice/[place_id]` renders the three-column Call Prep page. Status badges and filters added to existing sidebar. Analyzer modified to clear cached scripts and auto-set status on re-analysis.

**Tech Stack:** Python (OpenAI), FastAPI, Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.

**Reference spec:** [docs/specs/2026-04-17-phase3-call-playbook-crm-design.md](../../specs/2026-04-17-phase3-call-playbook-crm-design.md)

**Responsibility boundaries:**
- `src/scriptgen.py` — ONLY module that generates playbook content (GPT or mock). Returns `{ sections: [...] }`.
- `web/components/script-view.tsx` — ONLY component that renders playbook sections. Takes sections array as prop.
- `web/components/notes-panel.tsx` — ONLY component that handles notes save + activity history. Calls `updatePractice` API.
- `web/components/practice-info.tsx` — Read-only left column. Extracted from practice-card to avoid duplication.

## Task 1: Add `call_script` column to schema

**Files:**
- Modify: `supabase/schema.sql`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add column to schema file**

In `supabase/schema.sql`, add after the `hiring_signal_score` line:

```sql
  -- Phase 3 (Call Playbook)
  call_script text,
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run migration on Supabase**

Run:
```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
source .venv/Scripts/activate
python -c "
from src.settings import settings
from supabase import create_client
client = create_client(settings.supabase_url, settings.supabase_key)
# Add column if it doesn't exist — Supabase handles this via RPC or dashboard
# For now, use raw SQL via the Supabase dashboard SQL editor:
# ALTER TABLE practices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS call_script text;
print('Run in Supabase SQL editor: ALTER TABLE practices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS call_script text;')
"
```

If you have Supabase CLI, run: `supabase db push`. Otherwise, run the ALTER TABLE in the Supabase dashboard SQL editor.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add supabase/schema.sql
git commit -m "feat: add call_script column to practices schema"
```

## Task 2: Script generator with mock fallback (`src/scriptgen.py`)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/scriptgen.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create `src/scriptgen.py`**

```python
import json

from openai import AsyncOpenAI

from src.settings import settings

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a cold call script writer for Health & Virtuals, a healthcare staffing and talent acquisition company.

Given information about a healthcare practice (name, category, analysis summary, pain points, sales angles), generate a structured cold call playbook.

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Opening",
      "icon": "phone",

      "title": "Closing",
      "icon": "check",
      "content": "The closing script with next steps..."
    }
  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Opening: Reference the practice by name, mention something specific about them (category, size, detail from analysis)
- Discovery Questions: Ask about staffing challenges, hiring timeline, current workflow pain points
- Pitch: Directly address their specific pain points. Mention Health & Virtuals by name. Focus on staffing solutions they need.
- Objection Handling: Include "We already have a recruiter", "We can't afford it", "We're not hiring right now", and one specific to their situation
- Closing: Suggest a 15-minute meeting, offer a free staffing assessment, provide follow-up framing

Keep each section 3-6 sentences. Be conversational, not robotic. Use the rep's perspective ("I", "we at Health & Virtuals")."""

## Task 3: Modify analyzer to clear script + auto-set status

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/analyzer.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add `call_script` clearing to the analysis result**

At the end of the `analyze_practice` function (before the final `return`), add `call_script: None` to the returned dict. This ensures re-analysis clears any cached script.

In the real GPT path, after the line `return {`:
```python
    return {
        "summary": result.get("summary", ""),
        "pain_points": json.dumps(result.get("pain_points", [])),
        "sales_angles": json.dumps(result.get("sales_angles", [])),
        "lead_score": _clamp(result.get("lead_score", 0)),
        "urgency_score": _clamp(result.get("urgency_score", 0)),
        "hiring_signal_score": _clamp(result.get("hiring_signal_score", 0)),
        "call_script": None,
    }
```

In the `_mock_analysis` function, add to the returned dict:
```python
        "call_script": None,
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add src/analyzer.py
git commit -m "feat: clear cached call_script on re-analysis"
```

---

## Task 4: Add storage helpers for script + status/notes updates

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/storage.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add `update_practice_fields` function**

Add this function to the end of `src/storage.py`:

```python
def update_practice_fields(place_id: str, fields: dict) -> dict | None:
    """Update arbitrary fields on a practice. Returns updated row or None."""
    client = _get_client()
    if not client:
        return None
    result = (
        client.table("practices")
        .update(fields)
        .eq("place_id", place_id)
        .execute()
    )
    return result.data[0] if result.data else None
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add src/storage.py
git commit -m "feat: add update_practice_fields storage helper"
```

---

## Task 5: Add script + PATCH endpoints to FastAPI

**Files:**
- Modify: `api/index.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add imports**

Add to the imports at the top of `api/index.py`:

```python
from src.scriptgen import generate_script
from src.storage import upsert_practices, query_practices, get_practice, update_practice_analysis, update_practice_fields
```

(Replace the existing `from src.storage import ...` line to include `update_practice_fields`.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the script endpoints and PATCH endpoint**

Add after the existing `analyze` endpoint:

```python
# Status ordering for auto-transitions
STATUS_ORDER = [
    "NEW", "RESEARCHED", "SCRIPT READY", "CONTACTED",
    "FOLLOW UP", "MEETING SET", "PROPOSAL", "CLOSED WON", "CLOSED LOST",
]


def _should_auto_advance(current: str, target: str) -> bool:
    """Return True if target is ahead of current in the pipeline."""
    try:
        return STATUS_ORDER.index(target) > STATUS_ORDER.index(current)
    except ValueError:
        return False


@app.get("/api/practices/{place_id}/script")
async def get_script(place_id: str):
    """Get or generate the call script for a practice."""
    practice = get_practice(place_id)
    if not practice:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Practice not found")

    # Return cached script if it exists
    if practice.get("call_script"):
        import json
        return json.loads(practice["call_script"])

    # Generate new script
    script = await generate_script(
        name=practice["name"],
        category=practice.get("category"),
        summary=practice.get("summary"),
        pain_points=practice.get("pain_points"),
        sales_angles=practice.get("sales_angles"),
    )

    # Store script
    import json
    update_practice_fields(place_id, {"call_script": json.dumps(script)})

    # Auto-advance status to SCRIPT READY
    current_status = practice.get("status", "NEW")
    if _should_auto_advance(current_status, "SCRIPT READY"):
        update_practice_fields(place_id, {"status": "SCRIPT READY"})

    return script


@app.post("/api/practices/{place_id}/script")
async def regenerate_script(place_id: str):
    """Force regenerate the call script."""
    practice = get_practice(place_id)
    if not practice:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Practice not found")

    script = await generate_script(
        name=practice["name"],
        category=practice.get("category"),
        summary=practice.get("summary"),
        pain_points=practice.get("pain_points"),
        sales_angles=practice.get("sales_angles"),
    )

    import json
    update_practice_fields(place_id, {"call_script": json.dumps(script)})

    return script


class PatchPracticeRequest(BaseModel):
    status: str | None = None
    notes: str | None = None


@app.patch("/api/practices/{place_id}")
def patch_practice(place_id: str, body: PatchPracticeRequest):
    """Update status and/or notes for a practice."""
    fields: dict = {}
    if body.status is not None:
        if body.status not in STATUS_ORDER:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=f"Invalid status: {body.status}")
        fields["status"] = body.status
    if body.notes is not None:
        fields["notes"] = body.notes
    if not fields:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="No fields to update")

    updated = update_practice_fields(place_id, fields)
    if not updated:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Practice not found")
    return updated
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Also update the analyze endpoint to auto-set RESEARCHED status**

In the existing `analyze` endpoint, after `analysis = await analyze_practice(...)`, add auto-status logic. Replace the upsert block:

```python
    # Run analysis
    analysis = await analyze_practice(place_id, name, website, category)

    # Auto-advance status to RESEARCHED
    if existing:
        current_status = existing.get("status", "NEW")
        if _should_auto_advance(current_status, "RESEARCHED"):
            analysis["status"] = "RESEARCHED"

    # Upsert the analysis fields into Supabase
    updated = update_practice_analysis(place_id, analysis)
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Move `import json` to the top of the file**

Add `import json` to the imports at the top of `api/index.py` so the script endpoints don't need inline imports.

- [ ] **Step 5: Smoke test**

Run:
```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
source .venv/Scripts/activate
uvicorn api.index:app --port 8006 &
sleep 3
# Test script generation
curl -s http://localhost:8006/api/practices/real_dental_houston_001/script | python -c "
import sys, json
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'Sections: {len(d.get(\"sections\", []))}')
for s in d['sections']:
    print(f'  {s[\"title\"]}: {s[\"content\"][:50]}...')
"
echo ""
# Test PATCH
curl -s -X PATCH http://localhost:8006/api/practices/real_dental_houston_001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "CONTACTED", "notes": "Left voicemail"}' | python -c "
import sys, json
d = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f'Status: {d.get(\"status\")}')
print(f'Notes: {d.get(\"notes\")}')
"
```

Expected: 5 script sections printed, then status=CONTACTED and notes shown.

Kill the server after testing.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add api/index.py
git commit -m "feat: script GET/POST endpoints + PATCH status/notes + auto-status transitions"
```

## Task 6: Update TypeScript types + API client

**Files:**
- Modify: `web/lib/types.ts`
- Modify: `web/lib/api.ts`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add ScriptSection type and call_script field to `web/lib/types.ts`**

Add after the `Practice` interface:

```ts
export interface ScriptSection {
  title: string
  icon: string
  content: string
}

export interface Script {
  sections: ScriptSection[]
}
```

Add `call_script` to the Practice interface (in the Phase 2 optional section):

```ts
  call_script?: string | null // JSON string of Script
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add API functions to `web/lib/api.ts`**

Add to the end of the file:

```ts
export async function getScript(placeId: string): Promise<Script> {
  try {
    return await apiFetch<Script>(`/api/practices/${placeId}/script`)
  } catch {
    return mockScript(placeId)
  }
}

export async function regenerateScript(placeId: string): Promise<Script> {
  try {
    return await apiFetch<Script>(`/api/practices/${placeId}/script`, {
      method: "POST",
    })
  } catch {
    return mockScript(placeId)
  }
}

## Task 12: Update practice card with Call Prep button + status badge + name link

**Files:**
- Modify: `web/components/practice-card.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add imports and update props**

Add to the imports at the top:

```tsx
import Link from "next/link"
import { Phone, Globe, Star, Brain, Loader2, FileText } from "lucide-react"
import StatusBadge from "./status-badge"
```

(Add `Link`, `FileText`, and `StatusBadge` to existing imports. Keep all existing imports.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Make the name a link and add status badge + Call Prep button**

```tsx
      {/* Header row */}
      <div className="flex items-start justify-between gap-2">
        <Link
          href={`/practice/${practice.place_id}`}

        <div className="flex items-center gap-1.5 shrink-0">
          <StatusBadge status={practice.status} />
          {isScored && <ScoreBadge score={practice.lead_score!} />}
        </div>
      </div>
```

Add the "Call Prep" button in the action buttons div, after the Analyze button:

```tsx
        <Link
          href={`/practice/${practice.place_id}`}
          onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
          className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-xs px-3 py-1.5 rounded-lg bg-teal-600 text-white hover:bg-teal-700 transition"
        >
          <FileText className="w-3 h-3" /> Call Prep
        </Link>
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add web/components/practice-card.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): practice card — Call Prep button, status badge, name as link"
```

## Task 13: Add status filter to filter bar

**Files:**
- Modify: `web/components/filter-bar.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Update FilterBarProps and add status dropdown**

Replace the entire `web/components/filter-bar.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client"

import { ALL_STATUSES } from "./status-badge"

interface FilterBarProps {
  category: string
  onCategoryChange: (cat: string) => void
  minRating: number
  onMinRatingChange: (r: number) => void
  status: string
  onStatusChange: (status: string) => void
}

const CATEGORIES = [
  { value: "", label: "All categories" },
  { value: "dental", label: "Dental" },
  { value: "chiropractic", label: "Chiropractic" },
  { value: "urgent_care", label: "Urgent Care" },
  { value: "mental_health", label: "Mental Health" },
  { value: "primary_care", label: "Primary Care" },
  { value: "specialty", label: "Specialty" },
]

const STATUS_OPTIONS = [
  { value: "", label: "All statuses" },
  { value: "ACTIVE", label: "Active (excl. Closed Lost)" },
  ...ALL_STATUSES.map((s) => ({ value: s, label: s })),
]

export default function FilterBar({
  category,
  onCategoryChange,
  minRating,
  onMinRatingChange,
  status,
  onStatusChange,
}: FilterBarProps) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3 px-5 py-2 border-b border-gray-200/50 flex-wrap">
      <select
        value={category}
        onChange={(e) => onCategoryChange(e.target.value)}
        className="text-sm rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white/80 px-3 py-1.5
                   focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-teal-500/40"
      >
        {CATEGORIES.map((c) => (
          <option key={c.value} value={c.value}>
            {c.label}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <select
        value={status}
        onChange={(e) => onStatusChange(e.target.value)}
        className="text-sm rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white/80 px-3 py-1.5
                   focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-teal-500/40"
      >
        {STATUS_OPTIONS.map((s) => (
          <option key={s.value} value={s.value}>
            {s.label}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <label className="flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-gray-600">
        Min rating
        <input
          type="range"
          min={0}
          max={5}
          step={0.5}
          value={minRating}
          onChange={(e) => onMinRatingChange(Number(e.target.value))}
          className="w-24 accent-teal-600"
        />
        <span className="text-xs font-medium w-6">{minRating || "Any"}</span>
      </label>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add web/components/filter-bar.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): add status filter to filter bar"
```

## Task 14: Update main page with status filter

**Files:**
- Modify: `web/app/page.tsx`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add status state and filter logic**

Add state variable after `minRating`:

```tsx
  const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState("ACTIVE")
```

Update the `filtered` useMemo to include status filtering:

```tsx
  const filtered = useMemo(() => {
    const list = practices.filter((p) => {
      if (category && p.category !== category) return false
      if (minRating && (p.rating ?? 0) < minRating) return false
      if (statusFilter === "ACTIVE" && p.status === "CLOSED LOST") return false
      if (statusFilter && statusFilter !== "ACTIVE" && p.status !== statusFilter) return false
      return true
    })
    return list.sort((a, b) => {
      const aScore = a.lead_score ?? -1
      const bScore = b.lead_score ?? -1
      return bScore - aScore
    })
  }, [practices, category, minRating, statusFilter])
```

Update the `FilterBar` component to pass status props:

```tsx
          <FilterBar
            category={category}
            onCategoryChange={setCategory}
            minRating={minRating}
            onMinRatingChange={setMinRating}
            status={statusFilter}
            onStatusChange={setStatusFilter}
          />
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git add web/app/page.tsx
git commit -m "feat(web): status filter on main page (default: Active, excludes Closed Lost)"
```

## Task 15: Final verification and push

**Files:**
- None (verification only)

- [ ] **Step 1: Typecheck**

Run: `cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel/web" && npx tsc --noEmit`
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 2: Lint**

Run: `cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel/web" && npm run lint`
Expected: no errors.

- [ ] **Step 3: Production build**

Run: `cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel/web" && npm run build`
Expected: succeeds. Output should list `/` and `/practice/[place_id]` routes.

- [ ] **Step 4: Backend smoke test**

Run:
```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
source .venv/Scripts/activate
python -c "
import asyncio, json
from src.scriptgen import generate_script
result = asyncio.run(generate_script('Test Practice', 'dental', 'Summary', '[]', '[]'))
print(f'Script sections: {len(result[\"sections\"])}')
print('Backend OK')
"
```

Expected: 5 sections, Backend OK.

- [ ] **Step 5: Visual check**

Start backend and frontend, then verify in browser:
1. Practice cards show status badge (gray "NEW" by default) and "Call Prep" button.
2. Clicking practice name or "Call Prep" navigates to `/practice/[place_id]`.
3. Call Prep page shows three columns: practice info (left), playbook (center), notes (right).
4. Playbook has 5 sections with icons.
5. "Regenerate Script" button works.
6. Notes textarea saves on blur and on "Save Notes" click.
7. Status dropdown in header changes practice status.
8. Status filter in sidebar works (default "Active" hides CLOSED LOST).
9. "← Back to Map" returns to main page.

- [ ] **Step 6: Final commit (if fixes needed)**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git status
# If dirty:
git add -A web/ src/ api/
git commit -m "chore: post-build fixes"
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Push**

```bash
cd "c:/Users/Moiz Ahmed/hv-sales-intel"
git push
```

## Self-review notes

- **Spec coverage:** Call script generation → Tasks 2, 5. Caching + auto-regenerate → Tasks 3, 5. CRM statuses → Tasks 5, 7. Auto-transitions (RESEARCHED, SCRIPT READY) → Tasks 3, 5. Status badge → Tasks 7, 12. Status filter → Tasks 13, 14. Call Prep page three-column layout → Task 11. Practice info left column → Task 10. Script view center column → Task 8. Notes panel right column → Task 9. Card navigation (name link + Call Prep button) → Task 12. PATCH endpoint → Task 5. Mock fallback → Tasks 2, 6.
- **Placeholders:** None. All code blocks complete. Mock scripts cover dental and chiropractic with `{name}` replacement. Frontend mock in api.ts covers all 5 sections.
- **Type consistency:** `ScriptSection` type (Task 6) has `title`, `icon`, `content` — matches `scriptgen.py` output (Task 2), `script-view.tsx` props (Task 8), and API response shape (Task 5). `ALL_STATUSES` array exported from `status-badge.tsx` (Task 7) used in `filter-bar.tsx` (Task 13) and Call Prep page status dropdown (Task 11). `updatePractice` (Task 6) accepts `{ status?, notes? }` — matches PATCH endpoint (Task 5). `Practice.notes` field already exists in the type as `string` — the notes panel reads it correctly.
- **File sizes:** All new components under 100 lines. `scriptgen.py` is ~170 lines (includes mock data for 2 categories). Call Prep page is ~130 lines.
